# Strategy Pattern
_Agenda for Strategy Pattern_

> **Design Principle 1**   
> Identify the aspects of your code that vary and seperate them from what stays the same.

or in other words

> **Encasulate what varies**    
> If some aspects of your code is changing    
> ThatÂ´s a sign that you should pull it out (**cut**/paste) and seperate it (**paste** it in to its own class)
